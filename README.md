# CTrader
*CTrader is a Python library enabling easy integration with Binance API for crypto market data analysis, trade execution and portfolio managment.*

**Version available: ver Alpha 0.5**

**Only connector module available**

This release of CTrader includes the connector module. This module - wrapped in *csuite.py* - deals with instance creation, static data retrival and light data processing.
More features will be added to the CSuite over time; Backtesting capabilities are in the pipeline as well as simple trade execution. 

This library uses the Binance client library but simplifies data retrival & connection into 1 line commands.
